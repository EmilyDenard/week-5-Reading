   <p>We can always find a list of breakpoints in the right panel. That’s useful when we have many breakpoints in various files. It allows us to: Quickly jump to the breakpoint in the code (by clicking on it in the right panel).Temporarily disable the breakpoint by unchecking it.Remove the breakpoint by right-clicking and selecting Remove And so on</p>
